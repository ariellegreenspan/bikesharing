  Trip duration for the bulk of users, over 140,000, lasted about 10 minutes. The number of bikes being riden decreased after 10 minutes of usage, lowering steadily down to ~40,000 users at 20 minutes. Trip duration dropped to 20,000 bikes at 30 minutes andthe curve had completely flattenedat the ned of the hour, indicating almost no users were using the bikes for a complete hour.

  Most users used the bikes during the hours of 8 am, 5 pm, and 6 pm on Monday through Friday. Bikes were most infrequently used between the hours of 11 pm and 4 am throughout the week. On Saturdays, the bikes were most prominently used at 11 am and 12 pm, but overall usage was pretty consistent between 10 am and 8 pm, as opposed to during Monday through Friday when usage tends to occur mainly during rush hours. Sunday was the day of the week which saw the lowest bike usage. Peak bike usage on Sundays occured between 12:30 pm and 5:30 pm.
